      Favicons are small images that are used by the browser to represent the web page.
      They are displayed in the browser tab, bookmarks, history, etc.
      This is also used by the operating system to represent the web page in the taskbar, start menu, etc.
      So, it is important to set the favicon to a meaningful image that represents the web page.

      The query string `?v=2` is used to invalidate the cache of the favicon.
      When the favicon is updated, the query string should be updated to a new value to force the browser to fetch the new favicon.
